# Review Details Per Item Report (Context Based)

## Details
- This report can be exported on a collection of items of any type from the project tree constructing a single sheet excel export. The report will gather active reviews the item is included on, building a row of review details per item. 

- The report will include the following fields per row: Item API ID, Item Type Key, Name, Review ID, Review Name, Review Version, Review Status, 
Close Date, # of Approvers, # of Items, Users who Approved the review, Users who Rejected the Review, # of Approvals, # of Rejections, and # of Comments per review.
